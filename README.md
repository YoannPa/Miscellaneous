# Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous scripts...

## Reinstall Packages
This folder contains scripts I use when I want to reinstall packages (Linux, R or Python) I used in a former configuration.  

## Variant_Density_along_DNA_Sequence_1.0
R script to plot the density of variants contained in a VCF file along the DNA sequence you have annotated (Chromosome, Scaffold, Contig, Whole Genome, ...).  

## Others
* `funRDS.R` - A script containing functions related to RDS file manipulations.  
* `fun_stringeval.R` - A script containing functions related to string evaluations.  
* `Install_Conf_SSH_Vino.sh` - A script that install packages to use the Reminna video service for distant desktop access. It is also used for setting vino properly. No idea if this still works...  
* `My_RStudio_snippets.txt` - That file contains the snippets I used in RStudio.  
* `Projects_Kalendar_Generator.R` - Something I am thinking about currently, to organize in a smart way the time I want to dedicate to each project I am currently working on. Possibly an interesting tool to develop here...  
* `reboot_sound.sh` - A script that allow a user to reboot the sound syste on its computer when it is not working properly (Linux OS). It can be the case especially for laptop users with dual boot configurations... many other causes can explain sound malfunctions.
