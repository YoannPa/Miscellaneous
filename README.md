Miscellaneous scripts...

## Reinstall Packages
This folder contains scripts I use when I want to reinstall packages (Linux, R or Python3) I used in a former configuration.  

## Variant_Density_along_DNA_Sequence_1.0
R script to plot the density of variants contained in a VCF file along the DNA sequence you have annotated (Chromosome, Scaffold, Contig, Whole Genome, ...).  

## Others
* `Create_R_hexSticker.R` - Examples of how to generate HexStickers for a R packages.  
* `Exampl_load_custom_fonts.R` - An example of how to load downloaded fonts in R.  
* `format_boxplot_stats.R` - A script containing functions to parallel pre-compute boxplot statistics on a dataframe with the possibility to group columns.  
* `funRDS.R` - A script containing functions related to RDS files manipulations.  
* `fun_stringeval.R` - A script containing functions related to string evaluations.  
* `Install_Conf_SSH_Vino.sh` - A script that install packages to use the Reminna video service for distant desktop access. It is also used for setting vino properly. No idea if this still works...  
* `Methrix_Tutorial.R` - A script containing a small tutorial on how to use the Methrix R package for bisulfite sequencing data.  
* `parallel_histogram.R` - This function was an attempt to make the computation of histograms in R faster for large amount of data. It is unfortunately slower than the hist() and geom_histogram() functions.  
* `Projects_Kalendar_Generator.R` - Something I am thinking about currently, to organize in a smart way the time I want to dedicate to each project I am currently working on. Possibly an interesting tool to develop here...  
* `r.snippets` - That file contains the snippets I used in RStudio.  
* `reboot_sound.sh` - A script that allow a user to reboot the sound system on its computer when it is not working properly (Linux OS). It can be the case especially for laptop users with dual boot configurations... many other causes can explain sound malfunctions.  
* `string_format.R` - A script containing functions related to strings formatting.
